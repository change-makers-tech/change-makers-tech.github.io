      out how to save them...

    <h2>What you can do?</h2>
    <p>
      You can use paper from managed forests. You can also help by replanting
      trees.
    </p>
    <h2>What not to do?</h2>
    <p>
      We should not buy paper if forests are not managed. Do not put paper in
      the normal bin because it can be recycled.

    <p>
      Vietnam has made great progress with reforestation efforts by setting
      targets and planting trees to expand forest cover. A major goal is to
      plant 1 billion trees!
